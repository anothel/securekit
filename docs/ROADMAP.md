# SecureKit Roadmap

Future work only. Completed work belongs in Git history and release notes, not a
standing changelog.

## Rules

1. Security, data loss, and format compatibility come first.
2. Keep the v1 free-function API stable unless real call sites prove otherwise.
3. Keep OpenSSL as the crypto backend.
4. Keep CMake install/export, the CLI, and GitHub Actions package checks as
   first-class release surfaces.
5. Do not add public API, wire formats, package channels, CI cost, or release
   ceremony without a written problem, regression check, and rollback plan.
6. Active roadmap items must name an existing SecureKit surface.

Release-impacting work must pass the matching configured build directory:

```sh
cmake --build build --config Release --target release-preflight
```

## Now

No active release-critical work is queued.

## Next

No active user-entry-point work is queued.

## Parked

These are blocked candidates, not queued work. Move one to `Now` or `Next` only
after its gate is proven and a runnable check is named.

- Result-style APIs: gate is two real call sites showing exceptions are the
  wrong boundary.
- Object-oriented APIs beyond packet streaming: gate is two real call sites
  duplicating lifecycle logic that free functions cannot express cleanly.
- New password-file KDF profile: gate is format spec, downgrade behavior,
  bounds, fixture policy, and at least three known-answer vectors.
- Additional streaming format: gate is a written threat model for
  plaintext-before-auth and output ownership.
- OpenSSL provider or FIPS helpers: gate is documented support policy and
  dedicated tests.
- Scheduled long-running fuzz: gate is corpus policy and useful smoke-target
  signal.
- Further negative compatibility fixture expansion: gate is a specific
  uncovered `FORMAT.md` reject rule found by comparing `docs/FORMAT.md` with
  `tests/fixtures/negative/README.md`.
- CLI split: gate is repeated edit conflicts in `src/cli/main.cpp`.
- Benchmarks: gate is stable correctness, format, and release checks.

## Not Planned

- Custom crypto primitives.
- Custom string classes or allocators.
- TLS or networking.
- Web framework middleware, including Express, Koa, Fastify, NestJS, JWT, CSRF,
  CORS, rate limiting, request validation, or diagnostic web routes.
- Secure key storage.
- Guaranteed memory erasure.
- Framework-scale abstractions without call-site pressure.
